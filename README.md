#  ChaCha20 Encryption Internship Project

This repository contains the deliverables for the internship project titled **"ChaCha20: A Modern Encryption Method and Implementation in Python"** under the supervision of **Dr. Mohamed Samir**.

##  Overview

ChaCha20 is a fast and secure stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. This project explores its structure, implementation, and performance in Python, both manually and using cryptographic libraries.

## ðŸ›  Implementations

### 1. Manual ChaCha20
- Built entirely from scratch using ARX operations (Add, Rotate, XOR)
- Full control of quarter rounds, state matrix, and keystream generation
- Contains benchmarking for encryption time

### 2. Optimized Manual Version
- Improved with local variable usage and efficient loop structures
- ~1.77Ã— speedup over the naive manual version

### 3. Cryptography Library Version
- Uses `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ChaCha20`
- Extremely fast and production-ready

##  Performance

| Implementation          | Time (ms)    |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Manual (Original)       | 4038.99 ms   |
| Manual (Optimized)      | 2276.56 ms   |
| Library (`cryptography`)| 1.61 ms      |

> Optimized version is **1.77Ã— faster** than the original manual code.

##  How to Test

Run any of the implementations with the sample file:

```bash
python src/chacha20_manual.py
python src/chacha20_optimized.py
python src/chacha20_library.py
```

Make sure `testing_file.txt` is present in the working directory. It will be encrypted and saved as `.bin`.

##  Final Report

A detailed report written in LaTeX can be found in the `/report/` folder. It covers:

- History and use cases of ChaCha20
- State matrix explanation
- ARX operations
- Manual and library implementation
- Side-channel attack resistance
- Performance benchmarking
- Optimization strategies
